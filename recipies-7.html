  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<li>1/2 cup (66 grams) coconut flour</li>
<li>3/4 cup (75 grams) almond flour</li>
<li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
<li>3 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
<li>7 tablespoons (98 grams) coconut oil or unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>1/2 cup (120 milliliters) maple syrup</li>
<li>2 tablespoons coconut sugar or brown sugar</li>
<li>1/2 cup (120 grams) canned pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>For the cinnamon sugar:</li>
<li>1/3 cup (67 grams) coconut sugar or granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>

<ol>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 Â°F.
    <li>Line a mini muffin pan with 24 muffin liners.
  <li>In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (coconut flour through salt).
  <li>In a separate medium bowl, mix together the wet ingredients (eggs through vanilla).
  <li>Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir just until combined.
  <li>Pour the batter evenly into the muffin liners, filling each liner until almost completely full. You'll likely have enough batter for another six donut holes.
  <li>Bake for 11-13 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. Turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely. These need to rest for at least an hour before serving, both because of taste and texture.
  <li>When ready to serve, mix the cinnamon with the sugar in a small bowl. Remove the liners and roll the donut holes in the cinnamon sugar. Warning: Do not leave sugar on over night.
  <li>Eat and enjoy!
